# JSnakes

A Snake game built entirely from scratch using JavaScript and raw WebGL â€” no libraries, no engines. This project is a learning experiment in game development and graphics programming with minimal abstractions.


## Features

- Built with raw WebGL
- Simple real-time game loop and collision handling
- Fully custom rendering pipeline

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/auilk/JSnake.git
cd JSnake
```

2. Open `index.html` directly in your browser. If you're using **VSCode**, it's **recommended** to use the **Live Server** extension to run the project and avoid any local file loading issues.

## Goals

- Understand the fundamentals of game and graphics programming
- Learn WebGL by building a project without any helper libraries
- Experiment with smooth motion and real-time rendering
